## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for production-ready code.
- Create feature branches from `main` using the format: `feature/your-feature-name`.
- For bug fixes, use: `fix/short-description`.
- For documentation, use: `docs/short-description`.

## Coding Standards
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Run the linter before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  # or
  yarn lint
  ```
- Write clear, concise comments where necessary.
- Avoid using rainbow color schemes; stick to the project's color palette.

## Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Format: `<type>: <short summary>` (e.g., `feat: add user login page`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
2. Open a pull request (PR) with a clear description of your changes.
3. Reference related issues if applicable (e.g., `Closes #123`).
4. Request reviews from team members.
5. Address feedback and make necessary changes.
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer.

## Reporting Issues
- Use the issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
- Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, etc.).
- Check for existing issues before creating a new one.

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions. For more details, refer to the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if available.
